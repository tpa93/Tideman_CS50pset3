# CS50 problem set week 3 - C
This repository shows my implementation of the related problem set.
https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/3/tideman/

During week 3 in CS50 the problem set given was to create a C console application for simulating the ranked pairs (tideman) election system.
With this simplified application it is possible to simulate this depending on the problem set conditions:

Given by the course was the main structure of the project. 
Implementing the following methods was up to the participant:
1. vote
2. record_preferences
3. add_pairs
4. sort_pairs
5. lock_pairs
6. print_winner

Feel free to explore my implementation. I'm open for any feedback.
